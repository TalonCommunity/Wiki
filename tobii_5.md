![Tobii 5 hardware](/media/tobii_5_hardware.png) <!-- .element height="50%" width="50%" -->

Currently the Tobii 5 has limited support. It currently runs at 33hz refresh rate instead of the 133hz it should have. You may experience the tracking as wobbly because of this. The zoom mouse in knausj may help with this.

### Setup

#### Ubuntu 18.04

- Connect your new Tobii 5c eye tracker via USB to a Windows computer that's connected to the internet. (Note: tested on Windows 10)
- Wndows should bring up the "Tobii Experience" configuration software automatically. This SW should recognize your Tobii 5 hardware and prompt you to start a setup process. You don't actually need to do this.
- Disconnect the tracker from the Windows machine and connect to your Ubuntu machine.
- Start up Talon. It should recognize your new hardware.
