### Setup

#### Ubuntu 18.04

- Connect your new Tobii 5c eye tracker via USB to a Windows computer that's connected to the internet. (Note: tested on Windows 10)
- Wndows should bring up the "Tobii Experience" configuration software automatically. This SW should recognize your Tobii 5 hardware and prompt you to start a setup process. You don't actually need to do this.
- Disconnect the tracker from the Windows machine and connect to your Ubuntu machine.
- Start up Talon. It should recognize your new hardware.
