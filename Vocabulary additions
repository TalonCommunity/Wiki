# Vocabulary additions

You can modify the vocabulary to allow Talon to recognize additional words, or change how recognition of a specific word is interpreted.

## Adding new words
as [can be seen](https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/master/code/vocabulary.py#L82) in the talon scripts, you can define new vocabulary in a CSV file.
this file `additional_words.csv` is placed in the `settings/` subdirectory of knausj_talon.

the file looks like this:
```csv
Word(s), Spoken Form (If Different)
N map, nmap
```

## Defining word replacements
similarly, you can define word replacements in `words_to_replace.csv`:

```csv
Replacement,Original
cache,cash
```
