# Integrating Talon With Other Software

This page documents helpful third party software and integrations that play nice with Talon. Things that let you navigate without a mouse or integrate key presses into complex apps should be added here :)

## Navigation Software

## Browser navigation

## Linux Accessibility Notes
Once Talon can interface with Linux's accessibility tools the only terminal emulators that provide interfaces are VTE-based ones like Termite (e.g. Kitty & Alacritty don't expose any information)
