### What hardware should I have?

### How can I contribute?

While Talon is closed source, there's plenty you can do to help:

* https://speech.talonvoice.com/ Extend the voice data set used for speech recognition training.
* Publish your talon commands on Github for others to use like https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon.
* Report issues at https://github.com/talonvoice/talon/issues
* Add more to these docs :)

### How do I enable verbose talon debugging?

Open your talon user directory, for example `~/.talon/user` on Linux. Open the `engines.py` file in an editor and change the line containing `W2lEngine()` to include the parameter `debug=True`. If a `debug=False` parameter already exists, in the `False` should be changed to `True`.

For example:
```
w2l = W2lEngine(model="en_US", debug=True)
```
