- The apps folder has command sets for use within different applications

## Application Classes

Where appropriate common applications have been tagged as being part of an application class,
for example firefox is classified as a browser.

A common set of commands applies to all applications within that class. For example,
saying `go address` takes the focus to the address bar regardless of which browser application
is running.
