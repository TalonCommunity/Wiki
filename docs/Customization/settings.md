# Settings

Talon's behavior can be changed by changing the value of settings within a `.talon` file inside a `settings():` block.

```talon
# Example talon file
settings():
    # Enable the Talon mode indicator
    user.mode_indicator_show = true
```

:::tip

Talon settings can be applied from any `.talon` file in the user directory, regardless of the filename or location.

:::

:::important

If the same setting is defined multiple times, Talon will use the setting value in the `.talon` file with the most specific context match.

| imgui.dark_mode | false         | If `true` enable dark mode for talon imgui menus (used for help menus in community)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| insert_wait     | 0             | Increase this if characters seem to be jumbled in a specific app when typing whole sentences. Default is 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| key_hold        | 16            | Increase this if you're playing a game and some keys aren't registering at all. You should probably increase it in 16ms increments, e.g. set it to 16ms or 32ms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| key_wait        | 1             | Increase this if modifier keys are getting dropped or if key presses are misbehaving even with the other two settings (`insert_wait` and `key_hold`) tuned. `key_wait` should be the last resort because it results in the slowest overall keypress rate. Default is 1.0 in milliseconds.                                                                                                     |
| speech.engine   |               | Determines which [speech engine](../Quickstart/Speech%20Engines/speech%20engines.md) talon uses to recognize input. This is useful for configuring dictation mode to use a different speech engine; for example, 'webspeech'.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| speech.timeout  |               | This determines how long a pause Talon waits for before deciding you've finished speaking and interpreting what you've just said as a sequence of commands. This parameter is generally very important; for example, it determines the amount of time you can pause between saying 'phrase' and the following phrase. It is measured in seconds; the default is 0.300, i.e. 300 milliseconds. |
