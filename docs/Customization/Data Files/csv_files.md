# `.csv` Files

:::docoscope Talon Community User File Set

:::

Files with a `.csv` extension store data in a text format with "Common Separated Values". For example, from [`abbreviations.csv`](/docs/Basic%20Usage/Command%20Mode/text-shortcuts.md#abbreviations):

```csv
Abbreviation,Spoken Form
jpg,J peg
abbr,abbreviate
abrt,abort
ack,acknowledge
addr,address
addrs,addresses
(only first few lines of file shown here)
```

Often the first line, and this is the case in the above example, contains the column names.
In this example, the first column (before the comma) is `Abbreviation`, and the one after is `Spoken Form`.
