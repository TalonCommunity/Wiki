## Alphabet

Talon has its own [alphabet](/docs/Basic%20Usage/Command%20Mode/single-characters.md#talon-alphabet), a set of words that you say instead of individual letters.

This is something that you may need to use fairly regularly, and so it should be something that is both:
- recognized with a high degree of accuracy by Talon
- easy for you to say and remember

If the defaults aren't suitable for you, then you may wish to try alternatives, with some [suggestions here](/docs/Resource%20Hub/Speech%20Recognition/improving_recognition_accuracy.md#alternatives-to-the-default-alphabet).

This is a talon list file
you can edit it in the talon community directory
for you can override the file as described
check: we're overriding then you need to copy the entire file, not just override the entries that you want to change
