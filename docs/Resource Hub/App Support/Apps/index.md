# Applications

## Using Supported Applications

In this context, a "supported application" is one where the community has written some voice commands
specific for the application.

At time of writing, the voice commands that have been written for supported applications are not documented
in this wiki, and you will need to use one of the methods below to find this out.

There also have been [cheatsheets](/docs/Resource%20Hub/talon_related_resources.md#odds-and-ends) generated by the community that may be of assistance.

## Method 1 - Using the help active command

Whilst the application is running and is the front most window, say `help active`.

For example, if firefox is the front most window, something similar to the following will be displayed.

Initially the `Help: Active Context Onlys` panel will be displayed. Then selecting the numbered entries
reveals the details of those voice commands.

     alt="screenshot of the help context panel with firefox active"
 />

:::note

There are a fair few entries listed under "context dependent" that are not specifically related to firefox, such as "edit vocabulary" and "screenshot".
The ones detailed below - `browser`, `navigation` and `tab` are directly linked to firefox voice commands.

 />

:::tip Syntax

The format of the displayed information is explained in detail in the section on [voice commands](/docs/Customization/TalonScript/voice-commands.md).

## Method 2 - Examining the talon files

Another method to discover what voice commands are available within an application, is by looking at its talon file.

For example, the `apps\firefox\firefox.talon` file has the following content:
```
app: firefox
-
tag(): browser
tag(): user.tabs

tab search:
    browser.focus_address()
    insert("% ")
tab search <user.text>$:
    browser.focus_address()
    insert("% {text}")
    key(down)

(sidebar | panel) bookmarks: user.firefox_bookmarks_sidebar()
(sidebar | panel) history: user.firefox_history_sidebar()

```

This shows the same information as through the help active command, and that firefox supports:
- the `tab search` command (two variations one with the text to search for)
- a command to toggle the visibility of the `bookmarks panel`
- a command to toggle the visibility of the `history panel`

However, the majority of available voice commands are specified by the presence of the two tag lines:
```talon
tag(): browser
tag(): user.tabs
```

To find out what specific commands are available thanks to the `browser` and `tabs` tags, you will need to look at the
talon files within the community user file set. This may be under the `tags` or `core` folders.

This leads us to the `tags\browser\browser.talon` and `core\windows_and_tabs\tabs.talon`

```talon
tag: browser
-
tag(): user.navigation

address bar | go address | go url: browser.focus_address()
go page | page focus: browser.focus_page()
address copy | url copy | copy address | copy url:
    browser.focus_address()
    sleep(50ms)
    edit.copy()
go home: browser.go_home()
go to {user.website}: browser.go(website)
go private: browser.open_private_window()
... 
(shortened for brevity)
```

```
tag: user.tabs
-
tab (open | new): app.tab_open()
tab (last | previous): app.tab_previous()
tab next: app.tab_next()
tab close: user.tab_close_wrapper()
tab (reopen | restore): app.tab_reopen()
go tab <number>: user.tab_jump(number)
go tab final: user.tab_final()
tab (duplicate | clone): user.tab_duplicate()
```

From the `browser.talon` file we see that there is another tagline:
```
tag(): user.navigation
```

We can go through the same process to drill down and find out what voice commands
are available thanks to this tag.

And from `core\navigation\navigation.talon` we find the following commands:
```
tag: user.navigation
-

go back: user.go_back()
go forward: user.go_forward()
```

## Application List

:::note Limited Support

The applications listed below do not necessarily have voice commands for all (or even the majority)
of actions that can be performed within the application.

Those actions can always be performed by controlling the mouse or using the application menu or
keyboard shortcuts.
