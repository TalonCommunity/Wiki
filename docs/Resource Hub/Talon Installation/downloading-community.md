# Downloading the Talon Community User File Set

After installing talon and a speech recognition engine, as described here
you will need to download a user file set. This wiki is all about the Talon community user file set
and so this page is about downloading that specific user file set.

This can be done using two different methods, using zip and using git.

The background to this choice is that if you use Talon for any period of time,
you can expect the following:

- The community will update the `user file set` with bug fixes and new features, and you will want
  to update your local copy of it.
- You might make your own changes to some of these files.

## Considerations

### About `zip`

This is easier to get started with Talon as it involves only downloading a single file and using standard
methods on your PC to extract all the files from it.

The disadvantage is longer term. Periodically on those occasions when you download the latest community user file set, you will manually need to keep track of which files you have changed
and make sure those changes aren't lost during the update.

In many cases, this disadvantage can be mitigated by following the recommendations SO BE COMPLETED

### About `git`

The benefit of `git`, is that it makes it easy to obtain the latest files without losing any changes you've made in the meantime.
This is a benefit when using Talon longer term.

If you haven't already heard of `git`, and if you are not particularly comfortable using a command terminal,
this will be harder to get started with Talon.

### Summary

If you are not particularly comfortable using a command terminal, and if you are just wanting to explore the suitability of Talon
you may wish to use the simpler method of downloading `zip` files.

You will always be able to switch to using `git` down the track.
