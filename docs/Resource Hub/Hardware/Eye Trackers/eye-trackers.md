# Eye Trackers

Check out the `#eye-tracking` channel in Slack, and the [Tobii 4c Tips](tobii_4c) page.

- Tobii 4C is a commonly used and recommended eye tracker, but it is slowly being superceded as the default as more folks are starting to use the Tobii 5. Talon also supports the Tobii PCEye Mini. Support for most 4th gen Tobii devices can be trivially added.
- [Tobii 5](https://gaming.tobii.com/product/eye-tracker-5/) is the newer model and may be easier to find than the 4C. This one does require a one-time initialization on a Windows PC with the Tobii software installed. Check out the dedicated [Tobii 5 page](./tobii_5.md).

## Windows Login plus Talon

Talon and Tobii software clash a bit. But you can keep the Tobii driver installed, and only disable the Tobii service, you can keep using the Tobii as a Windows Hello device (login via facial recognition), even while having the Tobii available for Talon.
