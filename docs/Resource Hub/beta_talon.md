The beta version of Talon is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and provides:

- Earlier access to new features

- Access to additional speech engine options

Installing the beta version requires [Patreon support](https://www.patreon.com/join/lunixbochs). After becoming a [beta tier Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/join/lunixbochs), join the [Talon Voice Slack](https://talonvoice.com/chat) and request access to the `#beta` channel from `@aegis`, the developer of Talon.
