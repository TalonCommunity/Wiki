Once you have completed the steps above and talon is working functionally, you can attempt to
[improve the recognition accuracy](/docs/Resource%20Hub/Speech%20Recognition/improving_recognition_accuracy.md).

## S1: Is the PC Is Recognizing Sound Input?

Your microphone is critical to your setup. If your microphone isn't working, then none of your voice commands will either. Testing this piece early may save you some time and help narrow down your troubleshooting to either hardware (microphone, audio interface, cables, etc) or software (talon, talon configuration, speech engine, etc).

Check that your computer is using the correct microphone and receiving sound input.

<details>
<summary role="button">Mac</summary>
<p>
Open System Preferences > Sound > Input. Check that the correct input device is selected and speak into the microphone. Watch the Input level as you speak; you should see the level rising and falling.
</p>
<img src="/img/resource_hub/sound_input_mac.gif"
     alt="gif of sound input window in system preferences on a Mac with input level moving"
 />
</details>

<details>
<summary role="button">Windows</summary>
<p>
Select Start > Settings > System > Sound. In Sound settings, go to Input > Test your microphone. Verify that the correct input device is selected and speak into the microphone. Look for a blue bar that should rise and fall as you speak.
</p>
</details>


## S2: Tips for PC audio troubleshooting

If you are not receiving any sound input, check your ancillary microphone equipment (cables, interfaces, preamps, etc.).

- Ensure your microphone is not muted.
- Check your cables and connections.
- Check your adapters and/or audio interfaces if you are using them. Examples: Shure X2U XLR-to-USB signal adapter or the DPA d:vice mobile audio interface. Check that they are connected properly and check any settings on the device, e.g., volume, gain, etc.


## S3: Check that Talon Platform is Operational

Look for the Talon icon in the menubar.

<details>
<summary role="button">Mac</summary>
<p>
Talon's icon should show up in the menu bar in the upper right corner of your screen:
</p>
<img src="/img/talon_ui/talon_menubar_awake.png"
     alt="screenshot of the desktop on a mac showing the talon icon in the top right menubar"

## S4: Make the Talon Platform Operational

## Nothing Happens When I Speak

If you are testing your setup with one of the [basic commands](/docs/Basic%20Usage/basic_usage.md) and getting no response at all, [follow this flow chart to start off with](./nothing-happens-when-i-speak.md).




## TODO

:::docotodo

Incorporate the following suggestions from https://github.com/TalonCommunity/Wiki/pull/312#issuecomment-2453041850

:::

Probably the piece that I think is most important to include is a standard list of troubleshooting instructions to use when "Talon doesn't understand me or is behaving in a flaky fashion". Some specific suggestions:

- Check for background noise as this can really confuse the voice activity detection.
- Note that Talon is more sensitive to microphone quality than many other speech recognition systems so do not assume that just because, for example, Dragon works fine that Talon will.
- Note that Talon is more sensitive to microphone volume/gain than other speech recognition systems and that many apps, particularly conferencing apps like Zoom, will adjust the system microphone gain themselves, which can cause your recognition performance to tank when you're not expecting it â€” usually there is a setting to turn this off but it may take some time to track down all the apps that do it.
- Explain the general behavior of how Talon chops up audio into utterances, both the benefits (reduced CPU consumption, command chaining) and the downsides (if the voice activity detector doesn't work in your case it will seem like Talon is not responding at all)

:::docofeedback

Is at worth considering consolidating some of the suggestions on this page together with
[improving accuracy](/docs/Resource%20Hub/Speech%20Recognition/improving_recognition_accuracy.md).

Could be a great candidate for a flow chart

## Talon Crashes During Use

Talon should recover from most errors itself, but if it crashes please report it in the Talon Slack with the output log.
