# Application List

All the voice commands listed under space command mode, are globally available regardless of which application is
active (frontmost).

Additionally, commands specific to the currently active application may also be [available](./available-commands.md).


:::note Limited Support

The applications listed below do not necessarily have voice commands for all (or even the majority)
of actions that can be performed within the application.

Those actions without an explicit command can always be performed by controlling the mouse, using the application menu or
keyboard shortcuts.
