# Talon Slack

Talon has a Slack community for users to get help, ask questions, and meet one another. If you are starting to use Talon, join the [Talon Slack](https://talonvoice.com/chat). This is the most efficient way to get questions answered if they are not covered in this wiki. There are also a few general channels, like `#health`, for those looking for resources and other folks who might be navigating complex injuries like RSI (Repetitive Strain Injuries) from typing.

A few notable channels:

- `#help`: get help with Talon setup, usage, or ask questions about Talon
- `#beta`: find beta download links and ask questions specific to the beta (this is a private channel that requires a patreon donation)
- `#health`: chat with others about computer health issues, share knowledge, find other folks who might be going through similar things
- `#talon-docs`: chat about Talon documentation such as this wiki
- `#hardware`: chat about hardware, e.g., microphones
