## Talon User Directory

The Talon user directory is located at:

| Operating System | Directory              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| MacOS/Linux      | `~/.talon/user/`       |
| Windows          | `%APPDATA%\Talon\user` |

It can be opened by using the `Open Talon Home` menu item from the `Scripting` menu.

 />


This is the directory in which you put the [Talon Community User File Set](#talon-community-user-file-set) during [installation](/docs/Quickstart/getting_started.md#4-install-a-talon-user-file-set). 
 
Talon doesn't care how you organize your files within this directory, any subdirectories or file names are just there to make things easier to understand for you and others.
