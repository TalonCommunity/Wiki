# Talon user file set list

The main Talon user file set for Talon is [Talon Community](https://github.com/talonhub/community), but there are several others. These range from 'base' user file sets that contain their whole Talon setup through to sets which build on top of the [Talon Community](https://github.com/talonhub/community) user file set functionality.

If intended for public consumption, these Talon user file sets are mostly annouced via the [Slack channel](https://talonvoice.com/chat). Aside from that there are a few ways you can discover them:

- You can make use of the [talon code search](https://search.talonvoice.com/search/). This aims to search all known github repositories containing Talon related code. If you're looking for integration with a particular application this is a good option.
- You can browse the [github talonvoice topic](https://github.com/topics/talonvoice). Repositories can optionally tag themselves with this to aid discoverability.
- You can take a look at the manually curated list below.

## User Interface

- [Talon Heads Up Display](https://github.com/chaosparrot/talon_hud) This heads up display is awesome because it shows things like when Talon is awake, asleep, what language mode active, prints a pretty history, And a whole bunch of other things that right now you have to memorize.

## Application specific

## Command builders and macros

Talon user sets that allow you to build voice commands more easily or define commands in a quick ad-hoc way. The [Talon Community](https://github.com/talonhub/community) has an ephemeral macro system built in, but these user file sets extend that further.

- [Talon UI helper](https://github.com/splondike/talon_ui_helper) Command wizard that lets you build TalonScript commands which work with the screen as an image. For example it lets you easily build a command to click an icon, or show an overlay for clicking items in a list.
- [Screen spots](https://github.com/AndrewDant/screen-spots) Lets you quickly save mouse positions on the screen and then click them with a short voice command. Useful for games with fixed UI element position.
