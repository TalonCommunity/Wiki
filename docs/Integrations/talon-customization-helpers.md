# Command builders and macros

The Talon Community has a basic ephemeral [macro system](/docs/Basic%20Usage/Command%20Mode/text-shortcuts.md#macro-recorder) built in.

These user file sets extend that further, and allow you to build voice commands with specific talon functionality.

| [Talon UI helper](https://github.com/splondike/talon_ui_helper) | Command wizard that lets you build TalonScript commands which work with the screen as an image. For example it lets you easily build a command to click an icon, or show an overlay for clicking items in a list. |
| [Screen spots](https://github.com/AndrewDant/screen-spots)      | Lets you quickly save mouse positions on the screen and then click them with a short voice command. Useful for games with fixed UI element position.                                                              |
