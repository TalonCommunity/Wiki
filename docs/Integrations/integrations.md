:::info Terminology

You may be more familiar with the terms plugin, extension or add-on rather than integrations.
It's the same idea.

## Comprehensive List

There is more talon related software available than that which is referred to in the categorized and curated lists above.

:::note Advanced

This section is aimed at the more advanced user.

:::

The main Talon user file set for Talon is [Talon Community](https://github.com/talonhub/community), but there are several others. These range from 'base' user file sets that contain their whole Talon setup through to sets which build on top of the [Talon Community](https://github.com/talonhub/community) user file set functionality.

If intended for public consumption, these Talon user file sets are mostly annouced via the [Slack channel](https://talonvoice.com/chat). Aside from that there are a few ways you can discover them:

- You can make use of the [talon code search](https://search.talonvoice.com/search/). This aims to search all known github repositories containing Talon related code. If you're looking for integration with a particular application this is a good option.
- You can browse the [github talonvoice topic](https://github.com/topics/talonvoice). Repositories can optionally tag themselves with this to aid discoverability.
