# Mouse Alternatives

The easiest way to control your mouse with Talon is to use an eye tracker. But this is fairly expensive hardware. There are several voice/noise only options in addition to the 'mouse grid' built in to [Talon Community](https://github.com/talonhub/community).

- [Dense Mouse Grid](https://github.com/tararoys/dense-mouse-grid/tree/dense_mouse_grid_2/dense_mouse_grid) Less obtrusive overlay combining a letter and number grid to position the mouse.
- [Flex Mouse Grid](https://github.com/brollin/flex-mouse-grid) Flex Mouse Grid extends the functionality of Dense Mouse Grid.
- [Alphabet Soup Mouse](https://github.com/tararoys/modified_full_mouse_grid) This mouse overlays a very dense grid of letters onto the screen for very precise mouse placement. Created by Aegis, TimoTimo, and TaraRoys.
- [crosshairs mouse guide mouse](https://github.com/tararoys/mouse_guide) Created by Aegis. Allows you to say very specific mouse coordinates and position the mouse precisely on the screen.
- [Racecar Mouse (AKA drawing mouse)](https://gist.github.com/timo/d3a8c871aca93aee4cd8b4fc57b15187) A mouse you can use to draw with Talon. It steers like a racecar around the screen. Created by Timotimo.
- [Hissing Mouse](https://gist.github.com/tararoys/cdabc3bab686abd8d9b585afd7c481da) Created by Tara Roys. A mouse that operates soley by hissing, and uses the idea that if you make a left turn you can get anywhere on the screen by 'circling the block.' Simplest possible no-words, no-hands, no need to memorize commands mouse.
