# Writing Code

Although it's possible to write code only with the features described in command mode,
there are additional features in Talon community that can make this more efficient.

This wiki is a starting point, but you will need to look at the community user file set `.talon` files to
know what commands are available for the programming languages in which you wish to write. These files live under the
`lang` subdirectory.

There are also some [common language commands](./common-commands.md) for language elements that are common to multiple languages.

To achieve this, Talon must know what is the current programming language, which is done through [language activation](language-activation.md).

:::tip Videos and Demonstrations

Here are some [videos and demonstrations](/docs/Resource%20Hub/talon_related_resources.md) of using Talon to write code.
Don't worry if it appears overwhelming, some were made by very experienced users
highlighting how efficiently coding using Talon can be.
