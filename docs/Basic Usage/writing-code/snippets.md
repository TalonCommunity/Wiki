# Snippets

:::note Feedback Sought

ronzulu: I haven't really explored snippets myself.

There currently seems to be definitions for java, javascript and python, but not other languages.

Is this feature tailored for advanced users? Compared with the standard voice commands defined under lang,
is this easier to use or more efficient?

would it be a fair assessment that if a user was writing in multiple languages, and not all of them
with snippet support, it would be simpler to just use the lang voice commands and not use snippets 
until they felt more comfortable with talon in general?
