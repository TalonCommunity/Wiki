# Basic Usage

:::info Talon Installation

There are a number of steps involved in the [installation of Talon](/docs/Resource%20Hub/Talon%20Installation/installation_guide.md).
Once you have completed that and entered a few letters as a test, you are ready for actually using Talon.

:::

Talon has three main [modes](./talon-modes.md), and when started it launches in command mode.

It's recommended to first learn what can be said in [command mode](./Command%20Mode/command_mode.md):

- starting with the [alphabet](/docs/Basic%20Usage/Command%20Mode/single-characters.md),
- then get familiar with the keys, symbols
- saying words and phrases (and how to format them),
- controlling the mouse, and
- [text and navigation](/docs/Basic%20Usage/Command%20Mode/text-and-navigation.md) commands.

Once you have the basics of text input down, try [copying some code](./writing-code/) from one window to another.

After that, explore using ordinal repetition for easily repeating a command without pausing (e.g., saying `go up fifth` will go up five lines), window switching (`focus chrome`), and moving around in your text editor of choice.

:::note vim

If you use vim, just start with the numbers and alphabet, otherwise look at generic_editor.talon as well at jetbrains, vscode, and any other integrations.
