# Letters, Numbers & Symbols

## Talon Alphabet

Talon has its own alphabet, a set of words that you say instead of individual letters.

For example, instead of saying `p` one would say the word `pit`.

The Talon alphabet can be displayed at any time by saying `help alphabet`.

:::note Uppercase Letters
For uppercase letters, you say the word `shift` before the word for the letter. For example, to get an uppercase `Z` you would say `shift zip`.

## Numbers

## Symbols
Talon has a set of names for each of the punctuation and other symbols on the keyboard.

This can be shown at any time by saying `help symbols`.

### Alternate Forms
As shown above, for some characters, there are multiple ways the character can be said. For example, you can say either `hash sign` or `number sign` for the character `#`

### Example

For example, to write `(?![a-z])` you would say:

```
(          ?             !                [           a   -    z   ]            )
left paren question mark exclamation mark left square air dash zip right square right paren
```

Or slightly shorter:

```
(     ?             !                [        a   -    z   ]        )
paren question mark exclamation mark l square air dash zip r square r paren
```

:::tip It's Okay to Pause
There is no need to say all of that in one breath. You can also say it as:
- `paren question mark exclamation mark` (think, breathe)
- `l square` (scratch head)
- `air dash zip`
- `r square r paren`
