# Symbols

Talon has a set of names for each of the punctuation and other symbols on the keyboard.

This can be shown at any time by saying `help symbols`.

## Alternate Forms
As shown above, for some characters, there are multiple ways the character can be said. For example, you can say either `hash sign` or `number sign` for the character `#`

## Example

For example, to write `(?![a-z])` you would say:

`left paren question mark exclamation mark left square air dash zip right square right paren`

Or slightly shorter:

`paren question mark exclamation mark l square air dash zip r square r paren`

:::tip It's Okay to Pause
There is no need to say all of that in one breath. You can also say it as:
- `paren question mark exclamation mark` (think, breathe)
- `l square` (scratch head)
- `air dash zip`
- `r square r paren`
