# Talon Alphabet

Talon has its own alphabet, a set of words that you say instead of individual letters.

For example, instead of saying `p` one would say the word `pit`.

The Talon alphabet can be displayed at any time by saying `help alphabet`.

## Uppercase Letters

For uppercase letters, you say the word `shift` before the word for the letter. For example, to get an uppercase `Z` you would say `shift zip`.
