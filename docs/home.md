# Home

ronzulu: I don't think that everyone would automatically know that there was useful information only accessible
through the Talon icon.

Therefore I think that there should be I link to that page
from a named menu item such as home.

As that page contains links to the main areas of the wiki there is no need for a separate quick start menu heading.

Make the `home` item on the main menu point to the landing page
