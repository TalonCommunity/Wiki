# Snippets

Snippets insert text with placeholders. Jump to the next placeholder using the `snip next` command. Insert a snippet by saying `snip {user.snippet}`, where \{user.snippet\} is a snippet name.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icXH-o3mwTU) demonstrates snippets.

You can find the snippets available for the active programming language with the `help snip` command.

Snippets are further documented in the community snippets folder [README](https://github.com/talonhub/community/blob/main/core/snippets/README.md), which describes the snippet file syntax and useful VSCode extensions for writing snippets.

## Editor Support

Snippets can be inserted directly through the VSCode snippet system if you have the [command server VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pokey.command-server) installed. This also lets `snip next` use VSCode's support for getting to the next snippet placeholder.

[Cursorless](https://www.cursorless.org/docs/user/installation/) is required to wrap code in snippets (see the video or read me for details on wrapping with snippets).

## Without Editor Support

Without editor support, `snip next` assumes that the cursor is on the same line as the current snippet placeholder. If you move the cursor to another line first and then use `snip next`, the cursor may be moved to the wrong position.

Community will try to insert snippets manually without editor support. Depending on your editor's settings, inserting a snippet may insert extra delimiters and disrupt indentation. You can set the `user.snippet_raw_text_paste` setting to true to always insert snippets (in contexts without editor support) through pasting, which will get correct formatting in some editors. You can also change the `user.snippet_raw_text_spaces_per_tab` setting to determine how many spaces to use per tab; in most cases, you should set this to -1 to use tabs instead of spaces. Most code editors will automatically expand tabs to spaces when pasting code, if so configured. Note that you should probably adjust these settings on a per-editor basis in a separate [.talon file](../Customization/talon-files.md) for each editor. You might be able to further address some formatting issues from your editor not supporting snippets by using an automatic code formatting extension.

## Snippet Actions

The community snippet actions can be useful for custom commands.

`user.insert_snippet` takes the body of a snippet as its argument and inserts the snippet. The following example uses this action to insert a C++ static cast operation. This does not require defining a snippet inside a snippet file. Example:

```talon
static cast: user.insert_snippet("static_cast<$1>($0)")
```

`user.insert_snippet_by_name` takes the name of a snippet as its first argument and a dictionary of substitutions as an optional second argument. This can be used to insert snippets defined in .snippet files using the names from the `name: ` field. Example:

```talon
return: user.insert_snippet_by_name("returnStatement")
```

The substitution dictionary for the second argument can be used to replace snippet stops programmatically before inserting a snippet. The following example shows replacing the `$1` and `$0` snippet stops programmatically. The dictionary maps the stop names to their string replacements. You omit the $ in the stop names.

```python
	def code_insert_function(text: str, selection: str):
        substitutions = {"1": text}
        if selection:
            substitutions["0"] = selection
        actions.user.insert_snippet_by_name("functionCall", substitutions)
```

The `user.insert_snippet_by_name_with_stop_at_end` action is the same as the `user.insert_snippet_by_name` action but adds a final stop (`$0`) at the end of the snippet before insertion unless the snippet already ends with the last stop (`$0` or highest-numbered). This is the default action used by community for inserting snippets by name with the `snip {user.snippet}` command.

The `user.insert_snippet_by_name_with_phrase` action takes 2 arguments: the name of the snippet to insert and then a phrase. This inserts the snippet and then replaces the snippet stop that has an associated formatter with the result of applying the formatter to the phrase. For instance, when used with the `functionDeclaration` snippet, the phrase formatted with the appropriate formatter gets used as the function name.

The `user.insert_snippet_by_name_with_phrase_and_stop_at_end` action does the same thing as `user.insert_snippet_by_name_with_phrase` but adds a stop at the end of the snippet before insertion unless the snippet already ends with a stop. This is the default action used by community used when inserting snippets that can take a phrase argument, such as `snip funk` using the dictated phrase as the function name, i.e. `snip funk function name`.

The `user.move_cursor_to_next_snippet_stop` action moves the cursor to the next snippet stop.
