# Voice Coding Examples

The following are examples of code and the Community commands used to dictate them. These examples could have been made shorter using some cursorless commands, but they only use Community commands for the sake of example.

## Adding Even Values

```python
def add_even_values(values):
    total = 0
    for v in values:
        if v % 2 == 0:
            total += v
    return total
example_values = [1, 3, 2, 4]
even_total = add_even_values(example_values)
print(even_total)
```

commands:

"snip funk add even values"

"word values snip next"

"word total op equals numb zero"

"slap snip for each vest"

"snip next word values snip next"

"snip if vest op mod numb two"

"is equal numb zero snip next"

"word total op plus equals vest"

"slap wipe twice snip return word total"

"slap wipe snake example values"

"op equals box numb one comma space"

"numb three comma space numb two comma space numb four"

"slap snake even total"

"op equals snake add even values"

"round snake example values"

"funk print snake even total"
