# Getting Started

## 1: Check System Requirements

Talon has various [system requirements](Hardware/hardware.md), covering the computer hardware, operating system and microphone hardware.


## 2: Download & Install Talon

<details>
  <summary>Linux Users</summary>
  - Download [Talon for Linux](https://talonvoice.com/dl/latest/talon-linux.tar.xz)

:::note
- Talon, like many tools for automation or accessibility, __does not support Wayland__
     - You will have to select an X11 session from your login manager.
    - This is supported by Gnome and Plasma and many others, but some environments like sway are explicitly Wayland-only.
-  To install the speech engine, you must use Talon's tray icon:
   * If you use stock Gnome, you need to install [AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/) to see it
   * If you use i3 or a system tray that doesn't support the `StatusNotifierItem` protocol, install [snixembed](https://git.sr.ht/~steef/snixembed) to add support.

## 3: Install a speech recognition engine

Talon uses a local speech recognition engine that translates voice audio to text.

One recognition engine that comes with Talon is known as `Conformer D`. To install it:
- Run the Talon app
- Click the Talon tray icon and select `Speech Recognition â†’ Conformer D`.

:::note 
For other engine options, see the [speech engine page](./Speech%20Engines/speech%20engines.md)

## 4: Install a Talon user file set

:::important
Talon does not come with voice commands out of the box. So at this point in the installation process,
Talon can not do anything useful.

It requires a `user file set` and
for beginners, we strongly recommend that you use the [Talon Community](https://github.com/talonhub/community) user file set. 

The whole wiki assumes this repository is used if not otherwise noted.
:::


See the [Talon Community README](https://github.com/talonhub/community?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for installation instructions.
