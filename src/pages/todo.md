# Things to Do

Put references in each of the community library files (talon and python files) to the relevant part of this documentation
so that developers changing functionality will know where the documentation needs to be changed.

For example, in: 
`C:\Users\ronny\AppData\Roaming\talon\user\talon-community\plugin\mouse\mouse.talon`

At a comment to say that the documentation is at:
`D:\github\talon-community-wiki\docs\Basic Usage\pc-control.md`

---

In the readme file, what should be done with these types of references:
```
C:\Users\ronny\AppData\Roaming\talon\user\talon-community\README.md

Formatter names (snake, dubstring) are defined [here](core/text/formatters.py#L245). Formatter-related commands are defined in [text.talon](core/text/text.talon#L8).

There could be useful information in there, even though I'm hoping that most of the content of that read me will be deleted
 as the information the useful information has been included in the wiki and should not be duplicated in the readme.

Check the original version of that file as I deleted some of those references before thinking that there was useful info in there.
```
