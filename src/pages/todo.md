# Things to Do

Put references in each of the community library files (talon and python files) to the relevant part of this documentation
so that developers changing functionality will know where the documentation needs to be changed.

For example, in:
`C:\Users\ronny\AppData\Roaming\talon\user\talon-community\plugin\mouse\mouse.talon`

At a comment to say that the documentation is at:
`D:\github\talon-community-wiki\docs\Basic Usage\pc-control.md`

---

In the readme file, what should be done with these types of references:

```
C:\Users\ronny\AppData\Roaming\talon\user\talon-community\README.md

Formatter names (snake, dubstring) are defined `[here](core/text/formatters.py#L245)`. Formatter-related commands are defined in `[text.talon](core/text/text.talon#L8)`.

There could be useful information in there, even though I'm hoping that most of the content of that read me will be deleted
 as the information the useful information has been included in the wiki and should not be duplicated in the readme.

Check the original version of that file as I deleted some of those references before thinking that there was useful info in there.
```

### what to do with the "user." terminology in this wiki

Remove user. from user level documentation...is any disadvantage in doing that?
For example, will it make it more difficult for users to understand what is displayed in help popups

### Is at okay to use mermaid given the vulnerabilities listed during installation:

```
C:\Users\ronny> C:\Users\ronny\AppData\Roaming\talon\user\talon-scripts\build-kb\Talon community wiki start.ps1

added 93 packages, and audited 1311 packages in 23s

319 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

19 vulnerabilities (2 low, 17 high)

To address issues that do not require attention, run:
  npm audit fix

To address all issues possible (including breaking changes), run:
  npm audit fix --force

Some issues need review, and may require choosing
a different dependency.

Run `npm audit` for details.

### Get mermaid working?

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
	SpeechRecognitionEnabled: Speech Recognition Enabled
    state SpeechRecognitionEnabled {
        [*] --> commandMode
        commandMode: Command Mode
        dictationMode: Dictation Mode
        commandMode --> dictationMode : "dictation mode"
        dictationMode --> commandMode : "command mode"
    }

    SpeechRecognitionDisabled: Speech Recognition Disabled
    state SpeechRecognitionDisabled {
        sleepMode: Sleep Mode
    }

	SpeechRecognitionEnabled --> SpeechRecognitionDisabled : "go to sleep"
	SpeechRecognitionDisabled --> SpeechRecognitionEnabled : "wake up"

```

### zip versus git

The readme discourages users from installing by downloading the zip file and recommends using git instead.

I've changed this to a neutral approach of explaining the advantages and disadvantages of each method.

### consolidating descriptions between the library read me documentation and that here in the wiki

For example, the library read me has a section called "ðŸ’¡ Tip: Overriding cleanly", and this wiki has
similar information in a section called "Overriding existing voice commands"

### Explain generation of images from graphml files

- `screens` has a command for talon to show the index associated with each of your computer screens for the sake of moving windows to different screens
- `snippets` has commands for inserting snippets of code for various languages
- `text` has commands for inserting and reformatting text
