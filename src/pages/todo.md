# Things to Do

Put references in each of the community library files (talon and python files) to the relevant part of this documentation
so that developers changing functionality will know where the documentation needs to be changed.

For example, in: 
`C:\Users\ronny\AppData\Roaming\talon\user\talon-community\plugin\mouse\mouse.talon`

At a comment to say that the documentation is at:
`D:\github\talon-community-wiki\docs\Basic Usage\pc-control.md`
