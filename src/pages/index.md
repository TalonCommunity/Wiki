# Welcome to the Talon Community Wiki!

## What is Talon

[Talon](https://talonvoice.com) is a hands-free input replacement for the keyboard and mouse. Talon enables people who have limited use of their hands or want to stop using their hands to write code, play video games, and in general have unrestricted use of their computer. Whether you are here because you have an injury, want to prevent an injury, or are just interested in voice tech, we welcome everyone.

Talon is free to use and ongoing development is made possible by [donations on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/lunixbochs).

## Goal of this Wiki

The goal of this wiki is to provide information and documentation for the users of Talon. As the software is under rapid development, this wiki is in a constant state of "work in progress". Some of this content exists temporarily until the official Talon Docs are created.
