Dictating and controlling your computer with voice can be frustrating if your accent isn't a US one, and especially so if it is not even Anglophone. This page aims to collate tips and resources for such speakers.

# If you're looking for resources to sound more like someone from the US ...

* https://rachelsenglish.com/ is an excellent resource. Features detailed videos and discussion of the mechanics behind the various sounds. (At the risk of saying the obvious: you shouldn't try to change your accent if you don't want to. This is meant only as a tip for those who want to do so.)

## Alternatives to the default alphabet

* Speakers of non-rhotic dialectics of English (i.e. your 'r's don't sound like an American's) may find it helpful to change `air` from the alphabet; e.g., someone from the UK on the Slack uses `arch` instead.
* I (ym) have personally found that `met` works well as a replacement for `made`.
* And if you struggle with `whale`, there's also `whip` --- though it may not be the best idea to make that change if you plan to use Talon in public.
